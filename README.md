## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React

I designed the site with accessibility in mind while also making it both stylish and minimal. All selections are labeled and there are minimal animations. Bold typography accomplishes lots of styling on its own. All sections - particularly the projects section - are reusable components which allow for easily adding more content. [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/examples/reactjs/) is used to handle form submissions.

Project images were generated with an [image generator](https://github.com/gare-Ware/screenshot-img-generator.git) I built.

## Lessons Learned:

Naturally, as I'm looking to launch my career and this being my first portfolio website, my initial instinct was to try and throw everything at the site. I started off with unecessary features and imports to accomplish all kinds of unecessary things. Luckily, I quickly reminded myself of the value in [adding less](https://css-tricks.com/add-less/). What I wound up with was a site that doesn't have a few of the fancy features I started with, but looks great, renders quickly, and gets it's job done efficiently.
