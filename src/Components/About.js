                I have an affinity for all things technology. Throughout my life and in any job I’ve had, this has always found a way to prove true. As toddler I spent most of my time tinkering with my computer. As a teenager I would flash custom ROM’s on my smartphone. As a waiter I would be implementing new POS systems to increase efficiency and sales.</p>
                <p className="about__body">I spent many years on a quest to sharpen my soft skills. But as I’ve gotten older, I've naturally returned to my roots. I am driven to finally pursue my true passion and commit to the world of web development. I have established some ambitious goals for myself and my journey to achieve them has begun. Please reach out if you would like to take part!</p>
